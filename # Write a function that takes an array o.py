# Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence.
# You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word.
# Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

      concat = concat + space + words[i]

    return concat
